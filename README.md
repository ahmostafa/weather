# Parse a weather service

A simple coding exercise that will test if:
* you can code Java
* you can create, open and parse an HTTP request
* you can fill an HTTP response with sensible data

Complete the method com.example.WeatherServlet.doGet

* You can use any Open Source library/code that will help you - 
  * But the library then needs to be included (typically as jar file) in WebContent/WEB-INF/lib
  * The code needs to work without us doing any extra work
* You can take as long as you like 
  * But we do not expect you to put in more than a few hours of work
  * In practice you should be able to commit your solution within one week of cloning this repository
* We expect readable coding 
  * Methods and perhaps even classes are your friends!
  * Comments are expected where it is not obvious what is happening
 
Clone the project into your own github repository. Once you are finished email us the name and branch of
your solution on github. We will clone and test it. Please refrain from changing your code once you have
contacted us.
